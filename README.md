ConsoleInventory.zip:
Simple Console project for inventory system that uses an array of structs (no database) to store information. Written using Visual Studio 2017 Community. I wrote this in the very first C sharp course completed.

ConsoleInventory.cs:
Since this is the only program in the ConsoleInventory project, I uploaded this separately so you can view the code without downloading zipped project file.

VendingMachine.zip:
Windows Forms project for a vending machine. It uses two windows forms, each in a tab. First tab and form are the vending machine interface for people purchasing a can of soda, and the second tab and form is for servicing the vending machine. Project logic was first written as a Console application, then added as a reference to a Windows Forms application. It uses classes, enums, multiple constructors in a class, properties, methods and helper methods. Written using Visual Studio 2017 Community.
