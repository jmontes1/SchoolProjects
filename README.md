ConsoleInventory.zip:
Simple Console project for inventory system that uses an array of structs (no database) to store information. Written using Visual Studio 2017 Community. I wrote this in the very first C sharp course completed.

ConsoleInventory.cs:
Since this is the only program in the ConsoleInventory project, I uploaded this separately so you can view the code without downloading zipped project file.
